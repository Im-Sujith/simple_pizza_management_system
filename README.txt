The pizza delivery management system works as follow.
The product information such as product_id, pizza_name, cost per unit and quantity is stored in pizza_list.txt.
Whenever any customer orders the pizza, the order details such as order_id, pizza type, quantity, amount is recorded using using customer_list.txt. 
A particular order may contain 1 or more pizza types so the total amount to be payable by the customer will be displayed. 
The program will provide a discount facility for the payment. Based on the order, quantity will be reduced.
A report will be generated showing the availability of the pizza at the end of the day. 
The details of the customer will be displayed in descending order based on the amount spent by the customer.
